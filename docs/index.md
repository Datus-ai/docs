# Introduction

**Datus Agent** is the first contextual data engineering platform that builds **evolvable context** for your data systems. Unlike traditional tools that only move data, Datus captures, learns, and evolves the knowledge around your data—transforming metadata, SQL history, semantic models, and metrics into a living knowledge graph that grounds AI queries and eliminates hallucinations.

With Datus, data engineers shift from writing repetitive SQL to building reusable, AI-ready context. Every query, correction, and domain rule becomes long-term memory—enabling specialized subagents that deliver accurate, domain-aware analytics to your entire organization.
